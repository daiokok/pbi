Microbiome analysis for phosphate-defense interaction

The code in this repository was used to analyze the microbial community assembled on roots of
plants growing in a wild soil (census) or on plates with a synthetic community (SynCom).

## Directories

The `census` directory contains code used to analyze the microbial community composition of
plants gorwing in wild Mason Farm soil.

The `syncom` directory contains code used to analyze the microbial community composition,
and the plant phenotypes, of plants growing on agar plates with a well-defined but complex
synthetic bacterial community, under different phosphate conditions.

The `misc` directory contains intermediate files that have been made available after
publication upon request. The `misc/unifrac` subdirectory contains UniFrac distance
matrices as calculated in QIIME/1.5.0 (described in [Castrillo *et al*. 2017](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature21417)).

## Data

The raw sequencing reads that underlie the data in these analysis are publicly available in
the European Nucleotide Archive's Short Read Archive under study accession: [PRJEB15671](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB15671).


## Functions files

Most scripts load one or two different functions.r files. Those two files are located at the main
directory.

The file that is referenced as "~/rhizogenomics/src/trunk/phosphate_code/functions.r" is
simply named `functions.r`.

The file that is referenced as "~/rhizogenomics/src/trunk/immune_code/PRR_propep/functions.r"
is named `functions_prrpropep.r`.
